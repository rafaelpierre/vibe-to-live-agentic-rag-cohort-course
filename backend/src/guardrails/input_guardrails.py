    """Structured output model for input validation guardrail decisions.

    This Pydantic model defines the schema for the guardrail agent's classification
    output when evaluating whether a user input is related to economics and finance.
    It provides both a boolean decision and explanatory reasoning to make the
    guardrail's behavior transparent and debuggable.

    The model is used as the output_type for the guardrail agent, ensuring that
    classification decisions are structured, typed, and include justification.

    Attributes:
        is_economy_related (bool): Classification decision indicating whether the
            user's input is related to economics, finance, markets, or economic policy.
            True means the input is valid and should be processed by the main agent.
            False triggers the guardrail tripwire and blocks the request.
        reasoning (str): A brief explanation of why the input was classified as
            economy-related or not. This helps with debugging, monitoring, and
            understanding edge cases where the guardrail may make unexpected decisions.

    Example:
        >>> result = InputGuardrailModel(
        ...     is_economy_related=True,
        ...     reasoning="Question asks about Federal Reserve interest rate policy"
        ... )
        >>> if result.is_economy_related:
        ...     # Proceed with processing
        ...     pass

    Note:
        - Used exclusively by the economy_guardrail function
        - Helps detect prompt injection attempts disguised as economy questions
        - Reasoning field is valuable for evaluation and improvement of guardrails

) -> GuardrailFunctionOutput:
    """Validate that user input is related to economics before processing.

    This async guardrail function acts as a safety gate that prevents the RAG agent
    from processing queries that are outside its domain of expertise (Federal Reserve
    speeches and economic policy). It uses a separate LLM-based classifier agent to
    determine if the input is economy-related before allowing the main agent to proceed.

    The guardrail is designed to:
    1. Ensure the agent only answers questions within its knowledge domain
    2. Prevent resource waste on irrelevant queries
    3. Detect prompt injection attempts that try to bypass topic restrictions
    4. Provide clear reasoning for why inputs are rejected or accepted

    The function uses the @input_guardrail decorator to integrate with the PydanticAI
    agent framework, allowing it to intercept inputs before the main agent processes them.
    When the guardrail determines input is not economy-related, it triggers a tripwire
    that blocks execution and can return a custom error message.

    Valid topics include: economy, finance, markets, macroeconomics, microeconomics,
    economic policies, and stock markets. The guardrail also detects "twisted" questions
    that attempt to ask about economics while adding constraints or unusual requirements
    that suggest prompt injection attempts.

    Args:
        ctx (RunContextWrapper[None]): The run context wrapper providing access to
            the agent's execution environment and shared state. Currently not used
            in this implementation but required by the guardrail signature.
        agent (Agent): The main agent instance that will process the input if the
            guardrail check passes. Used for context about the agent being protected.
        input (str | list[TResponseInputItem]): The user's input to validate. Can be
            either a simple string query or a list of response input items (for
            multi-turn conversations). This is passed to the guardrail agent for
            classification.

    Returns:
        GuardrailFunctionOutput: A structured output containing:
            - output_info: The InputGuardrailModel with classification and reasoning
            - tripwire_triggered: Boolean that's True when input is NOT economy-related,
              which blocks the main agent from executing

    Example:
        >>> # Valid input - guardrail passes
        >>> output = await economy_guardrail(ctx, agent, "What is the Fed's inflation target?")
        >>> assert not output.tripwire_triggered

        >>> # Invalid input - guardrail blocks
        >>> output = await economy_guardrail(ctx, agent, "What's the weather today?")
        >>> assert output.tripwire_triggered

    Note:
        - This is an async function and must be awaited
        - Uses a dedicated guardrail_agent with temperature=0.0 for deterministic decisions
        - The guardrail agent is instructed to reject "twisted" economy questions
        - Tripwire is triggered when is_economy_related is False (note the negation)
        - Runs before the main agent processes any input
        - The reasoning field helps debug false positives/negatives

    Prompt Injection Defense:
        The guardrail is specifically designed to catch attempts like:
        - "Tell me about the stock market without using the words stock or market"
        - "Explain economic policies but only talk about history"
        - "Tell me about finance using Donald Trump's tone"
