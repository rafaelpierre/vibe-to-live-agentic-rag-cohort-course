82851d8661559409,"{""query"":""impact of inflation on monetary policy""}","[{""content"": ""At the most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I dissented because I concluded that cutting the policy rate by 25 basis points was the appropriate stance of policy. In a speech I gave July 17, I laid out the case for cutting the policy rate at the July FOMC meeting and my views have not changed since then. I will recap the reasons for doing so.\n\nFirst, tariffs are one-off increases in the price level and do not cause inflation beyond a temporary increase. Standard central banking practice is to \""look through\"" such price-level effects as long as inflation expectations are anchored, which they are.\n\nSecond, a host of data argues that monetary policy should now be close to neutral, not restrictive. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth was 1.2 percent in the first half of this year and is expected to remain soft for the rest of 2025, much lower than the median of FOMC participants' estimates of longer-run GDP growth. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is 4.1 percent, near the Committee's longer-run estimate, and total inflation is close to our target at just slightly above 2 percent if we put aside tariff effects that I believe will be temporary. Taken together, the data imply the policy rate should be around neutral, which the median FOMC participant estimates is 3 percent, and not where we are—1.25 to 1.50 percentage points above 3 percent.\n\nMy final reason to favor a cut now is that while the labor market looks fine on the surface, once we account for expected data revisions, private-sector payroll growth is near stall speed, and other data suggest that the downside risks to the labor market have increased. With underlying inflation near target and the upside risks to inflation limited, we should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate.\n\nI fully respect the views of my colleagues on the FOMC that suggest we need to take a \""wait and see\"" approach regarding tariffs' effects on inflation. There is nothing wrong about having different views about how to interpret incoming data and using different economic arguments to predict how tariffs will impact the economy. These differences are a sign of a healthy and robust policy discussion.\n\nBut, I believe that the wait and see approach is overly cautious, and, in my opinion, does not properly balance the risks to the outlook and could lead to policy falling behind the curve. The price effects from tariffs have been small so far, and since we will likely not get clarity on tariff levels or their ultimate impact on the economy over the course of the next several months, it is possible that the labor market falters before that clarity is obtained—if it ever is obtained. When labor markets turn, they often turn fast. If we find ourselves needing to support the economy, waiting may unduly delay moving toward appropriate policy.\n\nMy position does not mean I believe the FOMC should reduce the policy rate along a predetermined path. We can cut now and see how the data evolves. If the tariff effects do not lead to a major shock to inflation, the Committee can continue reducing the rate at a moderate pace. If we do get significant upside surprises to inflation and employment, we can pause. But I see no reason that we should hold the policy rate at its current level and risk a sudden decline in the labor market."", ""metadata"": {""title"": ""Waller, Statement by Governor Christopher J.

Thank you for the invitation to speak to you. I am delighted to have the opportunity to address this distinguished group of macroeconomic forecasters. Today I will discuss how I approach monetary policy decisionmaking, and I will then describe some of the challenges we will likely face in the years ahead.1\n\nBefore turning to the main topic of my remarks, I would like to provide some context about my background and how that shapes my approach to my role as a policymaker. After serving for nearly seven years on the Board of Governors, earlier this year, the President appointed me as the Federal Reserve's Vice Chair for Supervision. My role as a financial regulator and my previous experience as a state bank regulator and community banker in Kansas give me a unique perspective on how to approach my responsibilities as a monetary policymaker. This experience informs how I think about economic conditions and the balance of risks to economic activity, the labor market, and inflation in assessing the appropriate stance and direction of policy.\n\nAs you know, the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy to support a strong and stable economy that works for all Americans. In doing so, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) conducts its responsibilities according to the congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability. The Fed pursues these goals by adjusting its monetary policy stance using a variety of tools, including setting interest rates, providing forward guidance about the expected future path of policy, and adjusting the size and composition of our balance sheet. Our primary monetary policy tool is the federal funds rate, a key interest rate for overnight borrowing by commercial banks that influences other interest rates throughout financial markets. Lower interest rates tend to stimulate demand—for housing, cars and other durable goods, and for business investment—which boosts economic activity and has the potential to push up inflation. Higher interest rates tend to slow the economy and tend to push inflation down.\n\nAchieving both of these goals is challenging when they are in tension. Policy actions to tame inflation, like raising the target range for the federal funds rate, can have an adverse effect on employment. By contrast, policy actions aimed at supporting employment that is below its maximum level can potentially increase risks to price stability. These are just a few of the challenges we face as policymakers. With that background, I will share more on my approach to our monetary policy responsibilities and the use of our existing toolkit. I consider my approach in terms of flexibility in shifting the focus on policy objectives when needed and a limited footprint in financial markets.\n\nA Flexible Approach to PolicymakingPursuing the objectives of the dual mandate at the same time means that we generally seek to achieve the maximum level of employment that is consistent with price stability. But the monetary policy objectives are not always complementary. Because our dual mandate places equal weight on both maximum employment and price stability, when these objectives are in tension it is important not to favor one side of the mandate over the other. In that circumstance, we should be flexible and direct our focus to the side of the mandate that deviates the most from its goal or that shows the greater risk of persistently departing from it. Hesitating to address existing or emerging departures from the dual-mandate goals, due to self-limitations stemming from an unwillingness to depart from outdated past policy communication, increases the likelihood that policymakers will need to implement abrupt and large policy corrections.\n\nAs we all remember in 2021, supply and demand imbalances, amplified by extraordinary stimulus from fiscal and monetary policies, led to a sharp rise in inflation over just a few months. By the second half of that year, amid growing inflationary pressures, it became clear that our monetary policy stance was too accommodative and that the FOMC needed to move toward a tighter policy stance. On a 12-month basis, total consumer price index (CPI) inflation rose from about 1-1/2 percent in early 2021 to about 9 percent in mid-2022. We began increasing the policy rate at the March 2022 FOMC meeting, when reported CPI inflation was already at about 8 percent and core personal consumption expenditures inflation was above 5 percent.\n\nIn my view, the accommodative forward guidance the Committee adopted in the September and the December 2020 postmeeting statements, which put more weight on the employment side of our mandate, pushed the mandated goals out of balance and contributed to the delay in the removal of monetary policy accommodation in 2021.2That forward guidance made it much more difficult for the FOMC to react to new information suggesting that risks and uncertainties had evolved in response to pandemic-related changes in the economy. This ultimately restricted our ability to respond to rising inflationary pressures before seeing any progress on the labor market. Ultimately, delaying taking appropriate action while inflation started to increase left us in a position in which we needed to course correct and catch up by raising the policy rate in large increments over a number of months.\n\nRecognizing the substantial risk that unacceptably high inflation could persist, and once the conditions in the labor market were moving toward the FOMC's goal of maximum employment, by the end of 2021 I shifted my focus to the inflation side of our mandate and to bringing inflation down toward our 2 percent goal. At the time, I argued in favor of taking prompt and forceful policy action to get inflation under control, which I saw as our primary responsibility at that time, as it had begun to impose a heavy burden on households and businesses. Of course, tightening policy and then maintaining a restrictive stance to lower inflation could have resulted in costs and risks to the labor market, but I saw far greater costs and risks in allowing inflation to persist. And, importantly, maintaining the commitment to restoring price stability is the best course to sustain a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone.\n\nAs I noted in recent remarks, we are now facing a very different economic environment.3Over the past several months, I have been pointing to a shift in economic conditions and in the balance of risks to our employment and inflation goals, calling attention to signs of potential labor market fragility. And I have argued that increasing signs of weakening labor market conditions provide a basis for proactively supporting the employment side of our mandate.\n\nRecent data show a materially more fragile labor market along with inflation that, excluding tariffs, has continued to hover not far above our target. Given this shift in labor market conditions, at last week's FOMC meeting I supported beginning the process of removing policy restraint and bringing the federal funds rate back to its neutral level.\n\nUp until the July FOMC meeting, even with inflation within range of our target, the Committee has focused primarily on the inflation side of the dual mandate. Now that we have seen many months of deteriorating labor market conditions, it is time for the Committee to act decisively and proactively to address decreasing labor market dynamism and emerging signs of fragility. In my view, the recent data, including the estimated payroll employment benchmark revisions, show that we are at serious risk of already being behind the curve in addressing deteriorating labor market conditions. Should these conditions continue, I am concerned that we will need to adjust policy at a faster pace and to a larger degree going forward.\n\nI recognize and appreciate concerns that we have not yet perfectly achieved our inflation goal. But under a flexible approach to policymaking, it is appropriate to focus on the side of the mandate that is showing signs of deterioration or fragility even though inflation is above but within range of our target. This shift is appropriate now because forecasters widely expect inflation to significantly decline next year, and as further deterioration in labor market conditions would likely lead to more persistent damage to the employment side of the mandate, that would be difficult to address with our tools.\n\nWith tariff-related price increases likely being a one-time effect, my view is that inflation will return to 2 percent after these effects dissipate. Because changes in monetary policy take time to work their way through the economy, it is appropriate to look through temporarily elevated inflation readings and therefore remove some policy restraint to avoid weakening in the labor market, provided that long-run inflation expectations remain well anchored.\n\nIn addition, putting tariffs aside, the U.S. economy may also be experiencing an extended productivity surge, in large part because of recent technological advances. And productivity growth has likely been higher than reported due to the downward benchmark revisions to payroll gains. These developments reinforce the case for removing policy restraint because monetary policy should accommodate productivity shocks that raise potential output.\n\nIn light of all these considerations, in my view, it was appropriate to begin the process of moving policy toward a more neutral stance at last week's FOMC meeting, and it has been appropriate to do so for several months. Moreover, the rising downside risks to employment and the potential for greater damage to the labor market underscore the need to shift our focus away from overemphasizing the latest data points.\n\nIn the past, I have supported data dependence as an approach that incorporates incoming data into the decisions that lie immediately ahead and further into the future. Our experience during and following the pandemic highlights the difficulty in assessing the current state of the economy and predicting how it will evolve in the presence of major supply- and demand-side shocks, possible structural changes in the economy, and real-time data and measurement uncertainty. With unusually high uncertainty around the state of the economy and the economic outlook, and with significant risks to our employment and price stability goals, judging where the economy is headed in the future is much more challenging. Therefore, it made sense in the past to consider and be informed by the incoming data and its implications for the outlook in assessing the appropriate path for monetary policy.\n\nBut today we are facing different conditions. I am concerned that the labor market could enter into a precarious phase, and there is a risk that a shock could tip it into a sudden and significant deterioration. An inflexible and dogmatic view of data dependence gives an inherently backward-looking view of the economy and would guarantee that we remain behind the curve, requiring us to catch up in the future.\n\nI think we should consider shifting our focus from overweighting the latest data points to a proactive forward-looking approach and making a forecast that reflects how the economy is likely to evolve going forward. Because policy actions take time to flow through to, or have their full effect on, the economy, labor markets, and inflation, it is important that we are making predictions about where the economy is headed and to act on those forecasts in real time. A forward-looking approach ensures that monetary policy can help support the economy. It also better positions us to avoid falling behind the curve and then having to implement abrupt and dramatic policy actions. In my view, it is more effective to act promptly and decisively in the face of fragility than to be forced to dramatically adjust policy after damage has occurred.\n\nA Limited Footprint – the Fed's Balance SheetI will turn now to discuss my views about how we use our balance sheet. As the runoff in our securities portfolio proceeds following extensive asset purchases during the pandemic, there are several issues with important implications regarding the size and the composition of the Fed's balance sheet in the longer run.\n\nOver the longer run, my preference is to maintain the smallest balance sheet possible with reserve balances at a level closer to scarce than ample. First, a smaller balance sheet would minimize the Fed's footprint in money markets and in Treasury markets. Of course, in order to efficiently implement monetary policy, it is necessary to have some footprint in these markets. Second, holding less-than-ample reserves would return us to a place where we are actively managing our balance sheet, identifying instead of masking signals of market stress. In my view, actively managing our balance sheet would give a more timely indication of stress and market functioning issues, as allowing a modest amount of volatility in money markets can enhance our understanding of market clearing points.\n\nLower levels of reserves may also incentivize banks to engage in more active management of their liquidity positions and liquidity risks. Finally, a lower terminal level of reserves and a smaller balance sheet as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) would provide the FOMC with the optionality to respond to future shocks or economic downturns without worrying whether there is enough room to expand the balance sheet as a potential tool.\n\nIn terms of the composition of the Fed's securities holdings in the longer run, I strongly support having a System Open Market Account portfolio that consists only of Treasury securities to minimize the effects of the Federal Reserve's holdings on the allocation of credit across the economy. Holding agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), or other non-Treasury securities, could be seen as selective credit allocation.\n\nI also look forward to revisiting the Committee's consideration of potential sales of our agency MBS holdings. Simply relying on MBS runoff will not allow returning to a Treasury-only portfolio within a credible time frame.\n\nThe longer-run maturity structure of the Federal Reserve's Treasury securities holdings is also an important consideration. One benefit of a Treasury portfolio maturity structure that mirrors the broader Treasury market is that the Fed's holdings would be \""neutral.\"" This means that these holdings would not disproportionately affect the pricing of any given maturity of Treasury security or provide incentives for the issuance of any given type of Treasury security. A balance sheet tilted slightly toward shorter-dated Treasury securities would allow a more flexible approach.\n\nFor example, the FOMC could reduce its shorter-dated Treasury securities holdings in favor of longer-dated Treasury securities if the Committee wanted to use the balance sheet to provide monetary policy accommodation without expanding the size of its securities holdings. This approach would be similar to the FOMC's maturity extension program in 2011 and 2012, sometimes referred to as \""Operation Twist.\"" It will be important to consider the potential costs and benefits to the Federal Reserve's Treasury securities maturity structure and the best ways to achieve the desired maturity structure over time.\n\nThe Nature and Use of Emergency ToolsI will turn now to the role for and the availability of policy tools like lending programs and facilities. During periods of extreme financial system stress, the Federal Reserve has the authority, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, to use tools, including lending facilities, to directly support the effective functioning of key financial markets and the flow of credit throughout the economy. During the pandemic, the Board extensively relied on the creation of lending programs that were designed to serve as backstops to support market functioning and the flow of credit during times of stress. The temporary nature of these types of lending facilities that are activated only during times of severe financial market stress makes them an attractive alternative to other tools. Lending programs are most effective as backstops when loans are offered at a penalty rate and are of short duration. When appropriately calibrated, they can help promote market functioning and the effective transmission of monetary policy but also limit the Federal Reserve's overall footprint in financial markets in the longer term.\n\nDespite their demonstrated effectiveness during times of financial market dysfunction, my view is that emergency lending facilities should be reserved for the single-purpose use in emergency circumstances and should not be institutionalized. In other words, they should not be converted to permanent standing facilities. Instead, they should be activated for only the most exceptionally stressed circumstances. Institutionalizing an activity that was created to temporarily respond to emergency conditions essentially normalizes an extreme emergency response to market illiquidity.\n\nI am concerned that converting emergency facilities created in the depths of a crisis into permanent standing facilities would potentially increase the Fed's footprint in financial markets and have adverse implications, such as distorting private-sector market dynamics and market pricing during normal, noncrisis times. My preference is to rely on these types of facilities only on an emergency basis to address exceptional circumstances. This approach ensures that potential counterparties transact in the private market during times of normal or even mildly stressed market conditions.\n\nA better option would be to announce the short duration of a facility at the time it is created and be clear that it will only exist while the conditions prevail. During the pandemic, we demonstrated the ability to bring these facilities online quickly, so communication reiterating that we stand ready to do it again, even if only on a \""just in time\"" basis, may, on its own, have a beneficial effect on market dynamics.\n\nI will conclude this part of my discussion by highlighting a current regulatory proposal that would return the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR) to a backstop rather than a binding constraint for bank-affiliated broker-dealers.\n\nTreasury Market IntermediationEven though the U.S. financial system is strong and resilient, over time there have been periods of market stress and volatility in Treasury market intermediation. And there are strong indications that leverage capital requirements may be contributing to vulnerabilities in the Treasury market, particularly in the face of unusually high trading volumes.\n\nIn late June, the Board, along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, approved a proposal to modify the eSLR, which applies to the U.S. global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Although leverage ratios are intended to serve as a capital \""backstop\"" to risk-based measures, the eSLR has become increasingly binding over time. This bindingness has been substantially driven by economic growth, inflation, and the level of reserves in the system. When leverage requirements become a firm's binding capital constraint, they can disincentivize low-risk, low-margin activities. Broker-dealer affiliates of the G-SIBs are significant participants in Treasury market intermediation, and the effect of a more binding eSLR has been to diminish the market intermediation capacity of these intermediaries. This was never the intent of the eSLR. The eSLR proposal would help return this leverage requirement to a more appropriate role as a capital backstop. This important, proactive step would also preserve the role of the eSLR in promoting safety, soundness, and financial stability, and that, as proposed, is also fully consistent with our international agreements.\n\nIn addition, once the GENIUS Act is implemented, stablecoin issuers are required to hold reserves equivalent to the value of stablecoin issuance, which can include U.S. Treasuries.4This additional demand could compound future episodes of Treasury market liquidity stress, increasing the importance of eSLR reform to ensure Treasury market functioning. Once finalized, the eSLR proposal would provide additional balance sheet capacity for G-SIBs to intermediate U.S. Treasury market activities. This change will help build market resilience and reduce the likelihood both of market dysfunction and of the need for the Fed to intervene, by implementing temporary modifications to the eSLR.\n\nReforming the eSLR would also directly address some of the problems that a permanent Federal Reserve facility like the standing repo facility (SRF) is intended to alleviate—for example, mitigating temporary repurchase agreement (repo) rate spikes at month-, quarter-, and year-ends caused by large banks being unwilling to provide a sufficient supply of Treasury market liquidity. In my view, adjusting leverage capital requirements could help refocus the role of the SRF as a liquidity backstop for Treasury market intermediation, rather than normalizing its use and enabling rate arbitrage to drive usage in periods of calm.\n\nAlthough at the July 2021 FOMC meeting I voted to convert ongoing open market operations into a permanent facility, I did so with significant reservations because, as I noted earlier, my preference would be to not institutionalize operations that addressed temporary market emergencies. At that time, I stated that we should have remained attentive to the unintended consequences of an SRF and be prepared to adjust its parameters as needed to address those effects.\n\nIn its current form, the SRF has a minimum bid rate set equal to the discount window primary credit rate, which is also equal to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate. As a result, the SRF, by design, is not fully positioned to serve only as a backstop during times of market dysfunction and stress. My preference would be for a minimum bid rate higher than the top of the federal funds rate target range in order to emphasize that the SRF's purpose is to serve only as a backstop. A rate above the top of the target range would be more likely to discourage use of the facility outside of exceptional market-wide episodes of acute stress. It seems likely that a rate that's not set at a sufficiently high level might still be considered an option for primary dealers experiencing idiosyncratic pressures outside of market-wide disruption. In my view, providing an outlet for dealers that experience these kinds of pressures should not be the intended purpose of this facility.\n\nWhile creating a \""release valve\"" to provide greater market liquidity has been a goal of the SRF, I remain concerned that one of its unintended consequences is to distort market signals by artificially affecting repo rate dynamics. It is not the Fed's role to replace or arbitrage private-market activities.\n\nHaving a minimum bid rate on the SRF that is not sufficiently elevated relative to market rates risks suppressing or distorting valuable signals stemming from overnight money markets. While balance sheet runoff is entering a new phase, it is especially important to be able to observe underlying reserve and money market conditions.\n\nChallenges for Monetary Policy AheadThroughout my tenure at the Federal Reserve Board, the U.S. economy has experienced many challenging times, including below-target inflation and low unemployment; the effects of the COVID-19 experience, with high unemployment, strong demand enabled by fiscal support, supply chain disruptions, and high inflation; several bank failures; extraordinary immigration; and last year's recalibration of our monetary policy stance. The problems we face are often different and require agility in our understanding of how the economy works and is likely to evolve.\n\nI will turn now to briefly discuss some challenges for monetary policy in the years ahead, including the potential for supply shocks, the transmission of monetary policy to long-term interest rates, the housing market, the artificial intelligence (AI) investment boom, and the ways that I see some of these factors affecting the neutral rate of interest.\n\nSupply ShocksSupply shocks, which move economic activity and inflation in opposite directions, can be challenging for monetary policy to address because they can put the pursuit of the dual-mandate goals in conflict.5The development of new technologies that raise productivity is an example of a positive supply shock that increases potential output, while supply chain disruptions are an example of a negative supply shock. To properly address these shocks, for situations in which the policy objectives are in tension, as implied by the FOMC's revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we need to consider how large and persistent the deviations implied by the shock to the price-stability and maximum-employment mandates will likely be.6Importantly, supply shocks can also affect demand, and so we need to assess how the relative effects on supply and demand are likely to evolve.\n\nTariffs can be seen as a negative shock to the supply of imported goods but can also be viewed as a surcharge on demand for imported goods. Like any surcharge on sales, the effects on inflation are likely short lived, as reduced demand increases slack in the economy and restrains any follow-on price increases, assuming that inflation expectations remain anchored. Therefore, it makes sense for monetary policy to mostly look through the one-off effect on prices and put more weight on the likely more persistent effects on demand and employment.\n\nA step-down in population growth is also a negative supply shock, as it slows the increase in the labor force and output. This development would also represent a negative shock to demand, with the two effects roughly balancing out over time. However, the source of the shock, whether due to lower immigration or the aging of the population, seems relevant. While aging of the population is a gradual process that is less likely to generate sudden deviations in either of our mandates, a shock to immigration can have sharper effects on demand in the near term, as supply is likely to adjust more slowly—for example, housing.\n\nTerm PremiumsA second challenge for monetary policy would be a significant rise in longer-term interest rates driven by higher term premiums, which could offset a reduction in the expectations component stemming from monetary policy easing. This scenario would weaken the transmission of changes in the policy rate to economic activity, as investment decisions of households and businesses are dependent on longer-term rates, such as mortgage rates and corporate bond yields. Although term premiums increased when the FOMC recalibrated the policy stance toward the end of last year, they have come down significantly so far this year, allowing for a reduction in longer-term interest rates.\n\nA further rise in the term premium could reflect higher compensation for expected inflation and increased risks that monetary policy may need to address future shocks to real activity or inflation. Some of the factors that could lead to higher term premiums would be concerns about fiscal sustainability and the FOMC's credibility to achieve its inflation goal.\n\nHousing MarketA third challenge for monetary policy would be a sharp housing market correction. Although supply factors have been weighing down on housing activity for a while, demand factors appear to have recently become the dominant force. Elevated mortgage rates may be exerting a more persistent drag, as income growth expectations have declined while house prices remain high relative to rents. Given very low housing affordability, existing home sales have remained depressed despite higher inventories of homes for sale. I am concerned that declines in house prices could accelerate, posing downside risks to housing wealth and inflation in the years ahead.\n\nArtificial IntelligenceFinally, the surge in AI investment could also be challenging for monetary policy. Investment in new technologies is likely to raise productivity and lower inflation in the medium term. Although the additional investment also boosts demand, the effects on productivity and supply are likely to occur relatively quickly, and the economy is less likely to tighten appreciably in the near term. In this case, monetary policy should refrain from restraining aggregate demand, as any deviation from maximum employment is likely to be temporary.\n\nThere is a risk that expectations of returns on these high-tech investments may be too optimistic and raise financial stability concerns. Although tech companies can largely self finance these investments, or easily access bond and equity markets, if expectations of future revenues do not materialize, we may see a large correction in equity markets and a slump in investment spending due to over-capacity. Such a correction would lead to a contraction in aggregate demand through lower household wealth and lower expected profits.\n\nNeutral Rate of InterestSome of the factors discussed here may be key influences on the neutral interest rate, or r*. The two factors that I am more attentive to are slower population growth and fiscal sustainability risks. Although these factors have opposite effects on the balance between savings and investment and r*, I see slower population growth and the aging of the population as more prominent factors in pulling down the neutral interest rate. If fiscal sustainability concerns are not addressed in the years ahead, by stabilizing or reversing the upward trajectory of the federal debt-to-GDP ratio, I am afraid that r* and interest rates could rise and crowd out private investment.\n\nClosing ThoughtsBefore we move on to the discussion, I'd like to touch on the supervision and regulatory work under way. We have made a lot of progress in the past few months since I became the Vice Chair for Supervision. And Congress has been hard at work considering important banking and digital assets legislation and the passage of the GENIUS Act.\n\nIn addition to working to implement the Fed's responsibilities under this law, we are making significant progress on a number of priorities in supervision and regulation. Early in my tenure, I described my approach to take a fresh look at our supervision and regulatory framework.7\n\nWe have made progress on a wide range of priorities in these past few months, including\n\nWhile we are making progress in a number of areas, there is much left to do. Some of this work will include improving the mergers and acquisitions process; reviewing the appropriateness of capital requirements for all banks, including revising the community bank leverage ratio and approaches for mutual banks; and addressing payments and check fraud. We are continuing to enhance examiner training and development, and we will continue to prioritize economic growth and safety and soundness in the bank regulatory framework.\n\nThank you again for the invitation to join you today. It's a pleasure to be here, and I look forward to our discussion.\n\n1.

I will then turn to the results of our second public review of our monetary policy framework, as captured in the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that we released today.\n\nCurrent Economic Conditions and Near-Term OutlookWhen I appeared at this podium one year ago, the economy was at an inflection point. Our policy rate had stood at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent for more than a year. That restrictive policy stance was appropriate to help bring down inflation and to foster a sustainable balance between aggregate demand and supply. Inflation had moved much closer to our objective, and the labor market had cooled from its formerly overheated state. Upside risks to inflation had diminished. But the unemployment rate had increased by almost a full percentage point, a development that historically has not occurred outside of recessions.1Over the subsequent three Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, we recalibrated our policy stance, setting the stage for the labor market to remain in balance near maximum employment over the past year(figure 1).\n\nThis year, the economy has faced new challenges. Significantly higher tariffs across our trading partners are remaking the global trading system. Tighter immigration policy has led to an abrupt slowdown in labor force growth. Over the longer run, changes in tax, spending, and regulatory policies may also have important implications for economic growth and productivity. There is significant uncertainty about where all of these polices will eventually settle and what their lasting effects on the economy will be.\n\nChanges in trade and immigration policies are affecting both demand and supply. In this environment, distinguishing cyclical developments from trend, or structural, developments is difficult. This distinction is critical because monetary policy can work to stabilize cyclical fluctuations but can do little to alter structural changes.\n\nThe labor market is a case in point. The July employment report released earlier this month showed that payroll job growth slowed to an average pace of only 35,000 per month over the past three months, down from 168,000 per month during 2024(figure 2).2This slowdown is much larger than assessed just a month ago, as the earlier figures for May and June were revised down substantially.3But it does not appear that the slowdown in job growth has opened up a large margin of slack in the labor market—an outcome we want to avoid. The unemployment rate, while edging up in July, stands at a historically low level of 4.2 percent and has been broadly stable over the past year. Other indicators of labor market conditions are also little changed or have softened only modestly, including quits, layoffs, the ratio of vacancies to unemployment, and nominal wage growth. Labor supply has softened in line with demand, sharply lowering the \""breakeven\"" rate of job creation needed to hold the unemployment rate constant. Indeed, labor force growth has slowed considerably this year with the sharp falloff in immigration, and the labor force participation rate has edged down in recent months.\n\nOverall, while the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers. This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising. And if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.\n\nAt the same time, GDP growth has slowed notably in the first half of this year to a pace of 1.2 percent, roughly half the 2.5 percent pace in 2024(figure 3). The decline in growth has largely reflected a slowdown in consumer spending. As with the labor market, some of the slowing in GDP likely reflects slower growth of supply or potential output.\n\nTurning to inflation, higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of goods. Estimates based on the latest available data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in July. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent, above their level a year ago. Within core, prices of goods increased 1.1 percent over the past 12 months, a notable shift from the modest decline seen over the course of 2024. In contrast, housing services inflation remains on a downward trend, and nonhousing services inflation is still running at a level a bit above what has been historically consistent with 2 percent inflation(figure 4).4\n\nThe effects of tariffs on consumer prices are now clearly visible. We expect those effects to accumulate over coming months, with high uncertainty about timing and amounts. The question that matters for monetary policy is whether these price increases are likely to materially raise the risk of an ongoing inflation problem. A reasonable base case is that the effects will be relatively short lived—a one-time shift in the price level. Of course, \""one-time\"" does not mean \""all at once.\"" It will continue to take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks. Moreover, tariff rates continue to evolve, potentially prolonging the adjustment process.\n\nIt is also possible, however, that the upward pressure on prices from tariffs could spur a more lasting inflation dynamic, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed. One possibility is that workers, who see their real incomes decline because of higher prices, demand and get higher wages from employers, setting off adverse wage–price dynamics. Given that the labor market is not particularly tight and faces increasing downside risks, that outcome does not seem likely.\n\nAnother possibility is that inflation expectations could move up, dragging actual inflation with them. Inflation has been above our target for more than four years and remains a prominent concern for households and businesses. Measures of longer-term inflation expectations, however, as reflected in market- and survey-based measures, appear to remain well anchored and consistent with our longer-run inflation objective of 2 percent.\n\nOf course, we cannot take the stability of inflation expectations for granted. Come what may, we will not allow a one-time increase in the price level to become an ongoing inflation problem.\n\nPutting the pieces together, what are the implications for monetary policy? In the near term, risks to inflation are tilted to the upside, and risks to employment to the downside—a challenging situation. When our goals are in tension like this, our framework calls for us to balance both sides of our dual mandate. Our policy rate is now 100 basis points closer to neutral than it was a year ago, and the stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance. Nonetheless, with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\n\nMonetary policy is not on a preset course. FOMC members will make these decisions, based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks. We will never deviate from that approach.\n\nEvolution of Monetary Policy FrameworkTurning to my second topic, our monetary policy framework is built on the unchanging foundation of our mandate from Congress to foster maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We remain fully committed to fulfilling our statutory mandate, and the revisions to our framework will support that mission across a broad range of economic conditions. Our revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which we refer to as our consensus statement, describes how we pursue our dual-mandate goals. It is designed to give the public a clear sense of how we think about monetary policy, and that understanding is important both for transparency and accountability, and for making monetary policy more effective.\n\nThe changes we made in this review are a natural progression, grounded in our ever-evolving understanding of our economy. We continue to build upon the initial consensus statement adopted in 2012 under Chair Ben Bernanke's leadership. Today's revised statement is the outcome of the second public review of our framework, which we conduct at five-year intervals.  This year's review included three elements: Fed Listens events at Reserve Banks around the country, a flagship research conference, and policymaker discussions and deliberations, supported by staff analysis, at a series of FOMC meetings.5\n\nIn approaching this year's review, a key objective has been to make sure that our framework is suitable across a broad range of economic conditions. At the same time, the framework needs to evolve with changes in the structure of the economy and our understanding of those changes. The Great Depression presented different challenges from those of the Great Inflation and the Great Moderation, which in turn are different from the ones we face today.6\n\nAt the time of the last review, we were living in a new normal, characterized by the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound (ELB), along with low growth, low inflation, and a very flat Phillips curve—meaning that inflation was not very responsive to slack in the economy.7To me, a statistic that captures that era is that our policy rate was stuck at the ELB for seven long years following the onset of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in late 2008. Many here will recall the sluggish growth and painfully slow recovery of that era. It appeared highly likely that if the economy experienced even a mild downturn, our policy rate would be back at the ELB very quickly, probably for another extended period. Inflation and inflation expectations could then decline in a weak economy, raising real interest rates as nominal rates were pinned near zero. Higher real rates would further weigh on job growth and reinforce the downward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations, triggering an adverse dynamic.\n\nThe economic conditions that brought the policy rate to the ELB and drove the 2020 framework changes were thought to be rooted in slow-moving global factors that would persist for an extended period—and might well have done so, if not for the pandemic.8The 2020 consensus statement included several features that addressed the ELB-related risks that had become increasingly prominent over the preceding two decades. We emphasized the importance of anchored longer-term inflation expectations to support both our price-stability and maximum-employment goals. Drawing on an extensive literature on strategies to mitigate risks associated with the ELB, we adopted flexible average inflation targeting—a \""makeup\"" strategy to ensure that inflation expectations would remain well anchored even with the ELB constraint.9In particular, we said that, following periods when inflation had been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy would likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\n\nIn the event, rather than low inflation and the ELB, the post-pandemic reopening brought the highest inflation in 40 years to economies around the world. Like most other central banks and private-sector analysts, through year-end 2021 we thought that inflation would subside fairly quickly without a sharp tightening in our policy stance(figure 5).10When it became clear that this was not the case, we responded forcefully, raising our policy rate by 5.25 percentage points over 16 months. That action, combined with the unwinding of pandemic supply disruptions, contributed to inflation moving much closer to our target without the painful rise in unemployment that has accompanied previous efforts to counter high inflation.\n\nElements of the Revised Consensus StatementThis year's review considered how economic conditions have evolved over the past five years. During this period, we saw that the inflation situation can change rapidly in the face of large shocks. In addition, interest rates are now substantially higher than was the case during the era between the GFC and the pandemic. With inflation above target, our policy rate is restrictive—modestly so, in my view. We cannot say for certain where rates will settle out over the longer run, but their neutral level may now be higher than during the 2010s, reflecting changes in productivity, demographics, fiscal policy, and other factors that affect the balance between saving and investment(figure 6). During the review, we discussed how the 2020 statement's focus on the ELB may have complicated communications about our response to high inflation. We concluded that the emphasis on an overly specific set of economic conditions may have led to some confusion, and, as a result, we made several important changes to the consensus statement to reflect that insight.\n\nFirst, we removed language indicating that the ELB was a defining feature of the economic landscape. Instead, we noted that our \""monetary policy strategy is designed to promote maximum employment and stable prices across a broad range of economic conditions.\"" The difficulty of operating near the ELB remains a potential concern, but it is not our primary focus. The revised statement reiterates that the Committee is prepared to use its full range of tools to achieve its maximum-employment and price-stability goals, particularly if the federal funds rate is constrained by the ELB.\n\nSecond, we returned to a framework of flexible inflation targeting and eliminated the \""makeup\"" strategy. As it turned out, the idea of an intentional, moderate inflation overshoot had proved irrelevant. There was nothing intentional or moderate about the inflation that arrived a few months after we announced our 2020 changes to the consensus statement, as I acknowledged publicly in 2021.11\n\nWell-anchored inflation expectations were critical to our success in bringing down inflation without a sharp increase in unemployment. Anchored expectations promote the return of inflation to target when adverse shocks drive inflation higher, and limit the risk of deflation when the economy weakens.12Further, they allow monetary policy to support maximum employment in economic downturns without compromising price stability. Our revised statement emphasizes our commitment to act forcefully to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored, to the benefit of both sides of our dual mandate. It also notes that \""price stability is essential for a sound and stable economy and supports the well-being of all Americans.\"" This theme came through loud and clear at ourFed Listensevents.13The past five years have been a painful reminder of the hardship that high inflation imposes, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of necessities.\n\nThird, our 2020 statement said that we would mitigate \""shortfalls,\"" rather than \""deviations,\"" from maximum employment. The use of \""shortfalls\"" reflected the insight that our real-time assessments of the natural rate of unemployment—and hence of \""maximum employment\""—are highly uncertain.14The later years of the post-GFC recovery featured employment running for an extended period above mainstream estimates of its sustainable level, along with inflation running persistently below our 2 percent target. In the absence of inflationary pressures, it might not be necessary to tighten policy based solely on uncertain real-time estimates of the natural rate of unemployment.15\n\nWe still have that view, but our use of the term \""shortfalls\"" was not always interpreted as intended, raising communications challenges. In particular, the use of \""shortfalls\"" was not intended as a commitment to permanently forswear preemption or to ignore labor market tightness. Accordingly, we removed \""shortfalls\"" from our statement. Instead, the revised document now states more precisely that \""the Committee recognizes that employment may at times run above real-time assessments of maximum employment without necessarily creating risks to price stability.\"" Of course, preemptive action would likely be warranted if tightness in the labor market or other factors pose risks to price stability.\n\nThe revised statement also notes that maximum employment is \""the highest level of employment that can be achieved on a sustained basis in a context of price stability.\"" This focus on promoting a strong labor market underscores the principle that \""durably achieving maximum employment fosters broad-based economic opportunities and benefits for all Americans.\""The feedback we received atFed Listensevents reinforced the value of a strong labor market for American households, employers, and communities.\n\nFourth, consistent with the removal of \""shortfalls,\"" we made changes to clarify our approach in periods when our employment and inflation objectives are not complementary. In those circumstances, we will follow a balanced approach in promoting them. The revised statement now more closely aligns with the original 2012 language. We take into account the extent of departures from our goals and the potentially different time horizons over which each is projected to return to a level consistent with our dual mandate. These principles guide our policy decisions today, as they did over the 2022–24 period, when the departure from our 2 percent inflation target was the overriding concern.\n\nIn addition to these changes, there is a great deal of continuity with past statements. The document continues to explain how we interpret the mandate Congress has given us and describes the policy framework that we believe will best promote maximum employment and price stability. We continue to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking and consider the lags in its effects on the economy. For this reason, our policy actions depend on the economic outlook and the balance of risks to that outlook. We continue to believe that setting a numerical goal for employment is unwise, because the maximum level of employment is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to monetary policy.\n\nWe also continue to view a longer-run inflation rate of 2 percent as most consistent with our dual-mandate goals. We believe that our commitment to this target is a key factor helping keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Experience has shown that 2 percent inflation is low enough to ensure that inflation is not a concern in household and business decisionmaking while also providing a central bank with some policy flexibility to provide accommodation during economic downturns.\n\nFinally, the revised consensus statement retained our commitment to conduct a public review roughly every five years. There is nothing magic about a five-year pace. That frequency allows policymakers to reassess structural features of the economy and to engage with the public, practitioners, and academics on the performance of our framework. It is also consistent with several global peers.\n\nConclusionIn closing, I want to thank President Schmid and all his staff who work so diligently to host this outstanding event annually. Counting a couple of virtual appearances during the pandemic, this is the eighth time I have had the honor to speak from this podium. Each year, this symposium offers the opportunity for Federal Reserve leaders to hear ideas from leading economic thinkers and focus on the challenges we face. The Kansas City Fed was wise to lure Chair Volcker to this national park more than 40 years ago, and I am proud to be part of that tradition.\n\n1. For example, after the July 2024 employment report, the 3-month average of the unemployment rate had increased more than 0.5 percentage point above its lowest value over the previous 12 months.

Using the consumer price index and other information, an estimate of the contribution of housing services to 12-month core PCE inflation in July was 0.7 percentage point, while core services excluding housing contributed 2.0 percentage points. The contribution from each of these categories remains slightly above its average during the 2002–07 period, during which core PCE inflation averaged about 2 percent. In contrast, the contribution of core goods to 12-month core PCE inflation in July was about 0.25 percentage point, compared with the 2002–07 average of −0.25 percentage point.Return to text\n\n5.

As such, I would like to be transparent on my thinking. Subsequent to last week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), it should be clear that my view of appropriate monetary policy diverges from those of other FOMC members; I view policy as very restrictive, believe it poses material risks to the Fed's employment mandate, and would like to explain why.\n\nThere's no perfect means for determining appropriate monetary policy at any given time. That said, rules of a Taylor type are a useful way to gauge where the federal funds rate should be set based on the prevailing macroeconomic conditions and outlook. Let me first say that I find these types of policy rules to be useful as indications, but I am not slavishly devoted to them.\n\nThe Taylor rule suggests policymakers ought to think about three key variables in determining the appropriate fed funds rate: inflation, the neutral rate of interest, and the output gap. As one might expect, changes in inflation and employment—one way of framing the output gap—receive due attention from Fed officials. However, changes in the neutral rate, or the policy rate that would be neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is at full employment, are often underappreciated.\n\nSome argue that leaving the neutral rate, which I will refer to as r*, out of the conversation makes sense because it is unobservable and therefore highly uncertain. But so are potential growth and the natural rate of unemployment, yet they are frequently updated and discussed. Because many r* estimates are based on empirical models requiring a great deal of time-series data, they can be backward-looking and slow to adjust. Moving too slowly to update a rapidly changing neutral rate raises the risk of policy mistakes.\n\nR* reflects the balance of saving and investment in an economy and it evolves over time with demographics, productivity, fiscal policy, and other factors. It is my view that previously high immigration rates and large fiscally driven decreases in net national saving, both of which raise neutral rates, were insufficiently accounted for in previous estimates of neutral rates. Monetary policy was not as tight as many believed. That same effect may be taking place today, but in the opposite direction. In my view, insufficiently accounting for the strong downward pressure on the neutral rate resulting from changes in border and fiscal policies is leading some to believe policy islessrestrictive than it actually is.\n\nToday, I will give explicit consideration to nonmonetary factors—such as shifts in border and tax policy, trade renegotiation, and regulatory dynamics—that can have substantial effects on the appropriate setting for monetary policy. I'll focus on the factors that have changed most meaningfully over the course of 2025 as they relate to my expectations for inflation, r*, and the output gap, emphasizing ones I feel are underappreciated.\n\nBefore I proceed, I want to be clear: I am not attempting to provide an impossible degree of precision, but a general ballpark. Based on this analysis, I believe the appropriate fed funds rate is in the mid-2 percent area, almost 2 percentage points lower than current policy. The Federal Reserve has been entrusted with the important goal of promoting price stability for the good of all American households and businesses, and I am committed to bringing inflation sustainably back to 2 percent. However, leaving policy restrictive by such a large degree brings significant risks for the Fed's employment mandate.\n\nPolicies Impacting InflationRentsI'll start with inflation. The general approach I take is to assume all components of inflation that I'm not explicitly addressing will continue at their current run rates. I look forward to breaking down my expectations for other components of inflation in the future, but today I'll focus on what I consider to be first-order changes to the inflation forecast.\n\nHousing represents nearly 16 percent of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, and more than double that in the consumer price index (CPI). Housing affordability is highly influential for Americans' perception of, and experience of, the economy.\n\nBecause measured inflation incorporates rental inflation with a lag, it has remained elevated above market rents for several years, infamously \""catching up.\"" While an index of all-tenant rents took time to incorporate the spike in new rents in 2021 and 2022, that gap subsequently closed, indicating the catch-up is complete.2Now, new rent indices show this inflation is well below all-tenant inflation, around 1 percent annualized.3\n\nRents for all tenants will fall toward this low rate as people moving or renewing leases sign at current market rates, and I expect CPI rent inflation will decline from its current level of roughly 3.5 percent to below 1.5 percent in 2027. This implies a roughly 0.3 percentage point decline in total PCE inflation; by early 2028, I expect that effect to grow to a 0.4 percentage point decline. Per a Taylor rule, that works out to an appropriate fed funds rate roughly half a percentage point lower than current shelter inflation would imply.4\n\nOne might characterize this view on rental inflation as optimistic. However, I believe forecasters have underappreciated the significant impact of immigration policy on rent inflation—both on the way up and, now, on the way down. Work by Albert Saiz finds an elasticity of rents with respect to the number of renters of about 1, identified from a large quasi-random immigration shock.5,iNet immigration averaged roughly 1 million per year in the decade leading up to the pandemic.6Given that roughly 100 million Americans rent, net zero immigration going forward would imply 1 point lower rent inflation per year.\n\nPolicies Affecting r*Population growthThe border story is also, in my view, affecting neutral rates. Steady-state population growth matters for neutral rates, and U.S. border policy has changed markedly, from effectively open borders to potentially negative net migration. Further, these effects may interact with a structurally aging population, which increases the supply of capital and reduces demand for investment. Indeed, analysis by Etienne Gagnon and others shows that demographic changes may have already lowered the neutral rate by over 1 percentage point since 1980.7\n\nThe U.S. population has grown by around 1 percent annually in recent years, driven in large part by illegal immigration. Already in the first half of this year, roughly 1.5 million of these immigrants have left the country, according to the Current Population Survey, though this number may be an overestimate due to nonresponse issues.8Assuming some overcounting, it is plausible to me that 2 million illegal immigrants will have exited the country by year-end, thereby reducing annual population growth from 1 percent to 0.4 percent. Based on estimates from both Weiske and Ho, a 1 percentage point drop in annual population growth can reduce r* by 0.6 percentage point. So, the expected decline in U.S. population growth equates to a nearly 0.4 percentage point drop in the neutral fed funds rate.9\n\nLabor market statistics and anecdotal evidence suggest border policy is exerting a major impact on the economy. While the effect would likely normalize over time, this reduced level of population growth is also consistent with zero net immigration in 2026 and 2027. It was just a few long years ago that there was widespread discussion about whether most developed economies would, due to declining fertility rates, converge to Japan's low interest rates without significant immigration; those economic dynamics are still a force, albeit among many others.\n\nIncreases in national saving from trade policyAdditionally, trade renegotiation and the tax legislation recently passed by the Congress should also affect r*. I think of this primarily through the increase in national saving—that is, the net supply of loanable funds.\n\nWith respect to tariffs, relatively small changes in some goods prices have led to what I view as unreasonable levels of concern. While my read of the elasticities and incidence theory is that exporting nations will have to lower their selling prices, I also believe tariffs will lead to substantial swings in net national saving.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates tariff revenue could reduce the federal budget deficit by over $380 billion per year over the coming decade.10This is a significant swing in the supply–demand balance for loanable funds, as national borrowing declines by a comparable amount. A 1 percentage point change in the deficit-to-GDP (gross domestic product) ratio moves r* by nearly four tenths of a percentage point, according to the average of estimates summarized by Rachel and Summers.11This 1.3 percent of GDP change in national saving reduces the neutral rate by half a percentage point.12\n\nTariffs are not the only means by which trade policy is affecting the supply of loanable funds. Loans and loan guarantees pledged by East Asian countries in exchange for relatively low tariff ceilings have reached $900 billion.13These guarantees entail an exogenous increase in credit supply, which research suggests would be around 7 percent.14Using Council of Economic Advisers' (CEA) estimates of the interest elasticity of investment and Michael Boskin's interest elasticity of saving, this would further reduce neutral policy rates by around two tenths of a percentage point.15\n\nIncreases in national saving from tax policyThe large tax law passed this year also has a strong effect on national saving.16There are, of course, other consequences of the tax law besides the increase in net national saving, which I'll discuss later in the context of the output gap.\n\nThe CEA calculates an increase in national saving of $3.83 trillion over the next 10 years (relative to the previous policy baseline), resulting from economic growth induced by tax policy.17This represents roughly 1.3 percent of GDP, implying a half of a percentage point reduction in r* and the appropriate policy rate through the Rachel–Summers channel.Indeed, the federal deficit in the second and third fiscal quarters of this year was nearly $140 billion less than in the comparable period last year. This is a small sample size but indicative, in my opinion, of the direction of the deficit.\n\nOn the other hand, the CEA estimates that the tax law will generate annual investment increases of up to 10 percent in the next several years relative to the previous policy baseline. This should be associated with an increase in r*, and thus the appropriate fed funds rate, of around three tenths of a point. Let me also note that while I am relying partially on previous CEA research at the moment, I look forward to working more with Board staff and their forecasts in the coming months.\n\nEffect of deregulation and energy on r*America's regulatory patchwork has become a material impediment to growth.18Economists tend to underappreciate the economic impact of regulations, largely because qualitative factors can be difficult to study empirically. In many cases, a regulation can serve as an infinite tax rate, prohibiting activity altogether. An interdiction on output because a special snail is found in a region will restrict output much more than any finite tax.\n\nRegulation hinders productivity growth, restricts capacity, and ultimately helps fuel inflation. Regulators may have good reason for doing so (maybe they value the snail), but we must be clear-eyed about the economic consequences.\n\nDeregulation raises the neutral rate of interest by increasing the marginal product of capital.19Analysis by Dawson and Seater shows that half of the output effects of deregulatory policy are channeled improvements in total factor productivity (TFP), the key ingredient to greater living standards and higher real wages for workers.20Previous CEA research on the benefits of deregulatory efforts suggests a roughly 0.5 percent annual boost to growth over a 20-year period, whereas CEA research on new energy policies suggests something closer to a 0.1 percent annual boost over a 10-year period.21The cumulative effect of these policies is anywhere from a 3 to nearly 9 percent increase in TFP, translating to about a 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point increase in r*.22\n\nPolicies Impacting the Output GapTax policyI'd like to shift from r* to the third component of the Taylor rule, the output gap, which reflects actual production's strength relative to the economy's potential. Analogously, policymakers frequently think of the employment gap as the difference between the actual unemployment rate and the lowest sustainable rate of unemployment that doesn't gin up inflation. While the substantial tax and spending cuts recently passed by the Congress increase net saving and therefore reduce r*, there are countervailing increases in appropriate policy via the output gap.\n\nThe tax law should significantly push out the economy's supply side, an important change to help minimize the potential for inflationary shocks. Reduced business and individual tax rates stimulate additional capital accumulation and labor supply. However, these work through expanding potentialandactual GDP and thus should leave the output gap relatively unchanged. Aggregate demand, however, is also boosted by reduced taxes on seniors and lower-wage workers, balanced somewhat by cuts to entitlement spending and student lending.\n\nRelative to a pretax law policy baseline, CEA calculations using Congressional Budget Office estimates found a static $80 billion or so reduction in revenue and a $130 billion or so reduction in annual spending over a decade. Despite a greater reduction in spending than taxes, the literature consistently finds the tax multiplier to be larger than the spending multiplier.23This implies an increase of actual output over potential of approximately $50 billion in the short run, or an increase in the output gap of nearly 0.2 percent of GDP. This translates into an increase in the appropriate federal funds rate of around 0.1 percentage point under the standard approach to the Taylor rule. The balanced-approach rule, which doubles the weight on the output gap and was favored by former Chairwoman Janet Yellen, would imply a 0.2 percentage point increase.24\n\nRegulatory and energy policiesReturning to deregulatory and energy policies: Typically, when a regulatory barrier is removed, there is an immediate increase in potential output, but it takes time for actual output to catch up. I expect recent policies to have this effect.\n\nUsing the same estimates for TFP as I used earlier, this suggests 0.2 to 0.6 percentage point of downward pressure on the output gap over the next couple of years.25That translates into a policy rate that is 0.1 to 0.3 point lower under a standard Taylor rule, or doubly as strong under the balanced-approach rule.\n\nAdding It All UpTo sum this all up, first we must adjust r* relative to a baseline based on the factors I've described. A variety of models reviewed by Gianluca Benigno and others arrive at a median real estimate for r* of 1.3 percent, and a range of around 1 to 2 percent.26Applying Okun's law with a natural unemployment rate of 4 percent, and PCE inflation at 2.6 percent, the standard Taylor rule approach implies the appropriate nominal fed funds rate prior to the forces considered today should be about 3.9 percent. A balanced approach suggests 3.6 percent. These are not all that far from where the FOMC has set interest rates!\n\nIncluding the shocks I've considered, I get a new real r* that is 1 to 1.2 percentage points lower, or near zero. That sounds low, but I think it's important to take these modelsseriously, notliterally,and as I've said, I think these models sometimes don't do a great job incorporating policy changes of the type I've discussed at the frequency I need. Instead, I suspect existing backward-looking estimates are too high because they insufficiently account for recent changes to fiscal and border policies that are depressing r*.\n\nWe can also look to financial markets. My preferred market-implied measure of r* is the five-year, five-year-forward rate on U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. That's around 2.3 percent, meaning the new real r* would be 1.1 percent when applying new policy pressures.\n\nIncluding the inflation and output channels along with the median model-implied r*, the fed funds rate should be around 2 to 2.25 percent under the standard Taylor rule approach. The balanced approach implies a rate around 1.5 to 2 percent. If we instead use the market-implied r*, these numbers would all be one full point higher.27\n\nTo help correct for the risk that the model-implied rate is too low, I weight its likelihood at two-thirds and give the market-implied r* a one-third weighting. I've given market pricing just one-third partially because I believe it is incorporating a policy premium to reflect uncertainty around trade policy. Using these weights results in an appropriate fed funds rate of approximately 2 percent under the balanced approach and 2.5 percent under the standard rule, although a simple summation ignores issues of timing.28\n\nTo be clear, I don't want to imply more precision than I think is possible in economics. Assumptions and approximations abound. Nevertheless, I must stake out a position, and this is my best ballpark estimation.\n\nThe upshot is that monetary policy is well into restrictive territory. Leaving short-term interest rates roughly 2 percentage points too tight risks unnecessary layoffs and higher unemployment. Thank you for this opportunity to share how I think about monetary policy at the moment; I'd be happy to take some questions.\n\nNote: Table weights for ex-ante r* are 2/3 from the model-implied results from Benigno and others (2024) and 1/3 from the market-implied rate from Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. FFR is federal funds rate. OBBB is One Big Beautiful Bill.\n\n1.

This $900 billion is only a subset of the more than $3 trillion of U.S. investment pledges made by foreign countries in recent months. While this pledged investment would certainly be expected to lead to new activity, the bulk of it would likely leave the supply–demand balance for loanable funds, and therefore r*, relatively unchanged. This is because, apart from the $900 billion in loan guarantees, much of these commitments are in the form of direct investment, which is less likely to exert pressure on r* despite a strong positive impact on output. Gokceli, Fidrmuc, and Ghosh (2022) find no evidence that FDI crowds out domestic investment in developed OECD countries; see Emre Gokceli, Jan Fidrmuc, and Sugata Ghosh (2022), \""Effect of Foreign Direct Investment on Economic Growth and Domestic Investment: Evidence from OECD Countries,\""European Journal of Business Science and Technology, vol. 8 (2), pp. 190–216.Return to text\n\n14. Work done by Bachas, Kim, and Yannelis (2021) indicates that loan guarantees contribute to increased credit supply, and the elasticity estimated in their work suggests that loan guarantees of this magnitude imply an exogenous 7 percent increase in credit supply. To translate this into an effect on r*, estimates of the interest elasticity of investment demand and the interest elasticity of saving supply can be used. The former can be backed out from the UCC elasticity of investment and the interest elasticity of UCC (which multiply to the interest elasticity of investment). Using this approach with parameters from Council of Economic Advisers (2025c) yields an interest elasticity of investment of approximately negative 0.3. Meanwhile, estimates from Boskin (1978) are used for the interest elasticity of saving. Boskin uses multiple estimation strategies and finds estimates centered around 0.3.

Based on all the data in hand, I believe this argument is even stronger today, and that the downside risks to the labor market have increased.\n\nIn July, I warned that job creation was weaker than it seemed in the payroll numbers and that data due in early September would indicate that payroll growth will be significantly lowered when annual revisions are made next spring. But even before then, job creation came in soft in the employment report for July, and May and June were revised down sharply, for a three-month average pace for total nonfarm payroll growth of only 35,000. After accounting for these revisions and what we will learn in a couple of weeks, the data are likely to indicate that employment actually shrank over those three months. I will have more to say about labor market data revisions and how they should be treated in evaluating the monthly jobs report, one of the most valuable tools we have for judging economic conditions.\n\nI favored reducing the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at the FOMC's July meeting, and subsequent data on the labor market and inflation indicate this was the right call. That also seems to be the message from financial markets, which now expect a 25- basis-point cut at the FOMC's September meeting and put significant odds on an additional one or two cuts at the final two meetings of 2025. As I will discuss, factoring out estimates of the temporary effects of import tariffs, underlying inflation remains close to 2 percent. I believe the data on economic activity, the labor market, and inflation support moving policy toward a neutral setting. Based on the median of FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run value of the federal funds rate, neutral is 125 to 150 basis points lower than the current setting. While I believe we should have cut in July, I am still hopeful that easing monetary policy at our next meeting can keep the labor market from deteriorating while returning inflation to the FOMC's goal of 2 percent. So, let's get on with it.\n\nEconomic activity has slowed significantly in 2025 from 2024. Growth for the first half of the year was 1.4 percent.iLooking ahead, the limited evidence we have is consistent with continued sluggish growth. We don't have much data for the second half, but smoothing through the monthly volatility, retail sales for July suggest that consumers are continuing to spend, albeit at a slower pace than last year. Meanwhile, manufacturing output in the report on industrial production was flat in July, and according to purchasing managers, new orders for manufacturing are consistent with a modest decline in the next few months. For the large majority of businesses outside of manufacturing, new orders are consistent with roughly flat production in the coming months.\n\nMany forecasters have said they expect household and business spending and investment decisions will be weighed down by tariffs—those enacted, and the uncertainty about tariff levels in the future. Tariffs affect the costs and profits of businesses and, to the degree that they raise prices, also affect the real disposable income of consumers. Some businesses will be directly affected by tariffs, but many more will be affected by how tariffs crimp household spending. Tariff effects on households and businesses also will weigh on employment. All of this is consistent with what my business contacts are telling me, which is that they are postponing investment and hiring because of the uncertainty about how tariffs will affect their input costs and demand for their products. That said, I'm starting to hear some rumblings that businesses cannot sit on the sidelines forever. So we could see, at least, investment projects that were postponed begin to pick up, which would be positive for the economy. But how employment decisions evolve is more up in the air. I will be monitoring these business decisions because they are key to how activity will unfold in the second half of the year.\n\nReturning to the labor market, risks are continuing to build. In my July 17 speech, I said that private-sector job creation was nearing stall speed, and the data received since then have put an exclamation point on this statement. I always say that one month is not a trend, but now we have three months of weak job-creation data from the Current Employment Statistics. After revisions included in the July report, private-sector job creation averaged 52,000 in May, June, and July, about half the rate in the first quarter of 2025. The headline numbers, including public-sector workers, are, as I noted earlier, even worse, but I tend to focus on the private sector as a better indication of the underlying momentum in the labor market.\n\nThat's the picture after the unusually large revisions to May and June payrolls and the soft reading for July that was included in the latest jobs report. In addition to those revisions, on September 9 we will get a preliminary estimate of what to expect in the annual \""benchmark\"" revisions to 2025 early next year. I estimate that monthly job creation will be reduced by an average of about 60,000 a month.3That would mean that private-sector employment actually shrank, on average, in the past three months and that job creation earlier in the year was weaker than currently reported.4\n\nI have heard the argument that declining labor supply due to lower immigration means that low jobs numbers aren't as bad as they look and that the \""breakeven\"" number for keeping the unemployment rate steady is declining. To those people, I would say: Yes, these estimates have been falling, but I haven't heard anyone say the breakeven level is negative. Supply-side changes can't account for the ugly jobs numbers of the past three months.\n\nOther data support the idea that labor demand may be on the edge of a sharp decline. For example, wage growth for people switching to new jobs is lower than for people staying in the same job, the opposite of what we see in a strong labor market. A few years ago, the rate of people quitting their jobs surged, and job switchers were getting substantially larger raises than those staying in their jobs. Today the quits rate is back down to its mid-2010s level, and these individuals must be switching jobs for reasons other than gains in compensation.\n\nAnother sign of a weakening in the labor market is that the unemployment rates for some cyclically sensitive groups of workers, such as teenagers, are up sharply this year, to levels, again, similar to those in the softer job market of the mid-2010s. Supplementing this hard evidence of falling labor demand is the consistent story from my business contacts that they are not hiring. The mix of reasons is not only uncertainty over tariff policy and slowing demand for their goods and services, but also, increasingly, uncertainty over how to use artificial intelligence, which is especially freezing hiring for some entry-level jobs.5\n\nThis softening in labor demand is occurring at the same time, as I noted earlier, that there is a decline in labor supply. I often hear the argument that the unemployment rate is the key labor market indicator because it reflects what is happening in both demand and supply. And given that the current unemployment rate is 4.2 percent, close to most estimates of maximum employment and barely changed over the last year, this suggests that the labor market is solid. While I would normally agree with this statement, I do not think it is accurate now. I believe that any decline in labor supply is only masking weakening demand in the labor market. Whether or not supply is down, weakening demand is not good, and it is specifically what monetary policy is intended to address.\n\nBefore I move on from the labor market, let me address a question of some public debate recently, which is the quality of the payroll data. As should be obvious from these remarks and others I have delivered, I consider the monthly jobs report, including its estimate of payroll employment, an absolutely indispensable tool in evaluating the economy and setting monetary policy, and that view is close to unanimous among economic forecasters and policymakers. Considering how important this data is in getting an accurate and reliable read on the state of the labor market, it is entirely appropriate to examine the quality of the jobs numbers and the process by which they are collected. There is always room for improvement in data collection and analysis. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and other agencies that collect economic data have benefited from expert committees of outside advisers who have provided advice on ways to improve data quality.\n\nThere has been substantial commentary since the last jobs report regarding the declining response rate of establishments and individuals in the employment survey and the outsized revisions of the data. This commentary has raised questions about the quality of the employment survey data. So I want to address this issue and clarify some facts about the survey response and the revisions. When the BLS sends out the establishment survey for a given month, it gives firms three months to return the survey—they can return it in the first month, the second month, or the third month. Some firms do not respond at all. Firms that submit their responses in the first month are the basis for the initial, or preliminary, payroll estimate. Those firms that respond in the second month get added to the first-month responders to get an updated number, which yields the first revision that is published a month later. Then the firms that respond in the final month provide the BLS with the final numbers for the original month. This is the second revision and is the official payroll estimate for that month.\n\nA decade ago, the response rate for the first month was 75 percent, meaning three-fourths of the firms surveyed responded immediately. But the initial response rate has fallen to 60 percent recently. Does that imply that the overall response rate for the entire three-month period has fallen? No, response rates by the final estimate have not fallen—about 95 percent of firms responded a decade ago, and that is how many are responding now. What has happened is that U.S. firms are slower in returning the survey. Ten years ago, if the survey had been sent to 100 firms, 75 would respond in the first month, and 20 firms would respond in the next two months. But now only 60 firms respond in the first month, and 35 firms respond in the second and third months. But in both cases, 95 out of 100 firms surveyed responded.6\n\nWhat are the implications of this delayed response pattern? First, if more data come in later in the survey period, then the initial estimate is less likely to accurately represent the final estimate, which means you are more likely to get significant revisions in the second and third months. The revisions do not mean the quality of the data has declined; it simply reflects the fact that more data is coming in late in the survey period.\n\nA second point is that revisions have been, on average, negative for the past couple of years, and while the recent revisions were large, revisions have not been getting bigger, on average, based on an analysis recently issued by economists at J.P. Morgan.7They did find that large revisions are often associated with major turning points in the labor market. One possibility is that the recent large revisions in the payroll data for May and June indicate the labor market is at an inflection point and may worsen in coming months.\n\nOverall, the delay in responses does mean that we can expect initial reports to be noisier and more prone to revision. One month of data has never constituted a trend, but it is going to be especially important to take near-month payroll data with a grain of salt and form a picture of the labor market based on several months of results and a range of other labor market indicators. I hope my analysis of the labor market shows you that I do exactly that.\n\nLet me now turn to the outlook for inflation. Earlier this month, we received consumer and producer price information for July that allows for an estimate of inflation based on personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the FOMC's preferred measure. Based on those reports, PCE inflation increased 2.6 percent over the 12 months ended in July, and PCE inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices increased 2.9 percent. We will get the official data tomorrow.\n\nInflation has increased since the first quarter, but these numbers include the effects of import tariff increases, which, with inflation expectations anchored, I continue to expect will only temporarily raise inflation. Federal Reserve staff has extracted the tariff effects of inflation, and their latest estimates imply that without these effects, underlying inflation continues to run close to the FOMC's 2 percent target.8\n\nThere is still considerable uncertainty about how much more, and how quickly, tariffs will pass through to consumer prices. I have seen estimates that vary widely in the share of tariffs borne by exporters, importers, and consumers, and that tells me that one must be careful not to presume that some will bear a lot more than others. I continue to assume that the three groups affected by tariffs will share the costs roughly equally—one-third, one-third, and one-third. Most forecasts are for 12-month inflation to continue to slowly increase for a couple more months, with monthly tariff effects dissipating by early 2026.\n\nI believe that monetary policy should look through the tariff effects on inflation. With underlying inflation close to 2 percent, market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, and the chances of an undesirable weakening in the labor market increased, proper risk management means the FOMC should be cutting the policy rate now. I felt this way in July, and all the evidence since then has led me to feel more strongly about it today. Based on what I know today, I would support a 25 basis point cut at the Committee's meeting on September 16 and 17. While there are signs of a weakening labor market, I worry that conditions could deteriorate further and quite rapidly, and I think it is important that the FOMC not wait until such a deterioration is under way and risk falling behind the curve in setting appropriate monetary policy.\n\nMy eagerness to move now is supported by my view that monetary policy is moderately restrictive. In June, the median of FOMC participants estimated that the longer-run value of the federal funds rate, akin to what it would be now without restricting or stimulating the economy, is 3 percent. With the target for the federal funds rate in a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, that means we are 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percentage points above neutral.\n\nWhile I judge that the FOMC should have begun this process in July, based on the data in hand, I don't believe that a cut of larger than 25 basis points is needed in September. That view, of course, could change if the employment report for August, due out a week from tomorrow, points to a substantially weakening economy and inflation remains well contained.\n\nI think there is a growing consensus that monetary policy needs to be more accommodative, and even some recognition that it would have been wise to begin this process in July. I don't believe that policy has fallen substantially behind the curve, but one way to signal that I don't intend to allow that happen is to talk about where we go after September. Like other participants, I will be updating my economic projections just before the next FOMC meeting, including my assessment of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate at the end of this year and next. The totality of the data and the outlook will determine how quickly I believe we need to move policy to a neutral setting, but as I stand here today, I anticipate additional cuts over the next three to six months, and the pace of rate cuts will be driven by the incoming data.\n\n1.

I also look at timely data that Federal Reserve staff maintains in collaboration with the employment services firm ADP to construct a measure of weekly payroll employment, which covers about 20 percent of the nation's private workforce. This measure is comparable to the one ADP publishes. The current May–July contour for the staff measure of ADP-based private employment is broadly consistent with that of the Current Employment Statistics numbers. And in the weeks after the July jobs report's reference period, preliminary estimates from ADP show continued deterioration.Return to text\n\n5.

            Answer: Inflation has a significant impact on monetary policy, especially under the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate to achieve maximum employment and price stability. When inflation is rising or remains above target, the Fed typically increases interest rates to help bring it down, even though this can slow economic growth and affect employment. Conversely, when inflation is near or below target and risks to the labor market rise, the Fed may lower interest rates to support economic activity and job creation.

Recent speeches underscore several key points:
- Higher inflation prompted the Fed to tighten policy by raising rates, but as inflation nears target and upside risks diminish, the focus can shift back to supporting employment (Waller 2025).
- Inflation and employment goals can be in tension. The Fed must balance the two, sometimes prioritizing price stability if inflation is high, and shifting to support employment if the labor market weakens (Bowman 2025; Powell 2025).
- Temporary shocks, such as tariffs, may cause a one-time rise in inflation, but monetary policy can ""look through"" these if long-term inflation expectations remain anchored (Powell 2025; Waller 2025).

Ultimately, persistent high inflation requires a restrictive (higher) policy stance, while declining inflation and labor market weakness call for more accommodative (lower) rates. The flexibility to shift stance as conditions evolve is essential for effective monetary policy.

            Answer: Interest rates are the primary tool used by central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, to conduct monetary policy. Adjusting the policy rate (such as the federal funds rate) influences borrowing costs, consumer spending, business investment, and overall economic activity.

- Lowering interest rates tends to stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper, encouraging spending and investment, which can boost employment and potentially lead to higher inflation.
- Raising interest rates tends to slow the economy by making borrowing more expensive, restraining spending and investment, thereby dampening inflation.

Fed officials highlight that the impact of interest rate changes involves trade-offs. For example, raising rates to combat inflation can risk weakening the labor market and increasing unemployment. Conversely, keeping rates too low for too long can fuel inflationary pressures.

Monetary policy actions take time to affect the economy—there are ""lags"" between policy changes and their impact. Policymakers stress the importance of being proactive, forward-looking, and flexible in their decisions, often responding to evolving data on economic growth, inflation, and employment. Recent speeches emphasize the need to balance risks to both sides of the Fed’s dual mandate: maximum employment and price stability.

Overall, interest rate adjustments remain central to managing the economy, influencing inflation and employment dynamics [Waller 2025; Bowman 2025; Jefferson 2025].
